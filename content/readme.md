Hi there! My name is Ezra M. Wingard, and I am a 2023 Graduate of SUNY Oswego, currently working on the [SC-WB Study](https://www.b-radlab.com/sc-wb-study.html) under Dr. Caitlin Hudac at the University of South Carolina. I have varying research interests, but the major question I seek to answer is "What is it like?" Current avenues of research that I am pursuing include: how our personal identity affects behaviors within adolescent social behaviors.
