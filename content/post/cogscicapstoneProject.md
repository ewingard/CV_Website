This project was conducted for my Cognitive Science Capstone (COG468) at SUNY Oswego. For this class, it served as the culmination of my studies within the Cognitive Science major. The COG468 Capstone entailed a research project on a subject relating to Cognitive Science, a final oral exam, creation and updates to my [course webpage](http://cs.oswego.edu/~ewingard/COG468WorkSite/) and other miscellaneous classwork that related to Cognitive Science.

For my project in the Capstone course, I chose to conduct research on the relationship between embodied cognition (EC) and aphantasia. Because there was no research specifically on the subject, I chose to synthesize new literature to relate the two subjects rather than have a literature review-style project. The final parts of my project for this capstone include my final paper and presentation, which are both attached to this page. (The presentation is linked via a button at the top of the page, and the final paper is below.)
