Aphantasia is a relatively newly [named](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26115582/) condition which describes the lack of mental imagery in the mind. It exists on a scale from no mental imagery (aphantasia) to extremely vivid mental imagery (hyperphantasia), which for visual imagery can be quantified through a test called the [VVIQ](https://aphantasia.com/vviq/), or Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire. There is also the QMI, pr [Questionnaire of Visual Imagery](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6082130/), which encompasses *all* mental imagery, not just visual imagery.

The study that I worked on with Dr. Theo Rhodes and Dr. Sien Hu at SUNY Oswego sought to answer the questions:

  1. Is there a difference on a mental rotation task in those with aphantasia versus those without aphantasia?
  2. How can we use the differences on a mental rotation task in the aphantasic versus non aphantasic population in order to learn more about the mental processes and behaviors associated with the condition?

In order to test this, we conducted a preliminary study during 2021 using the CABIN 3-T fMRI at the University of Rochester in order to see the physical differences between aphantasic and non-aphantasic individuals brains during the mental rotation task. A manuscript for publication is currently in preparation containing the results. Four adults with self-reported aphantasia and six adults without aphantasia participated in this study.

***NOTE.***
Preparations are in place to continue this study without gathering additional fMRI data. MouseTracking and solely behavioral information will be used to collect pertinent information on Aphantasia.
